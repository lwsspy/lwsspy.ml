``lwsspy.ml`` - Machine Learning Tools
======================================

Hi!

This a set of functions and classes that I have written to make my
machine learning life easier.

Feel free to use, fork/modify/pull etc. 
This is far from done/what I want it to look like and I welcome edits and 
suggestions. 

Cheers,

Lucas
